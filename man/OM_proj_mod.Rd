\title{Modify future natural mortality rate and recruitment in projection years}
\usage{
OM_proj_mod(OM, M_val = NaN, M_trend = 0, R_trend = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{OM}{An object of class OM}

\item{M_val}{A single value of M, an lower/upper range of M (uniformly sampled) or a per-simulation specification of M (vector nsim long)}

\item{M_trend}{A single value that is the annual percentage change in M (a value of 1 is a 1 percent increase per year in projection years) or a custom pattern in M for each projection year that is a factor (1 is no change)}

\item{R_trend}{A single value that is the annual percentage change in recruitment strength (a value of 1 is a 1 percent increase per year in projection years) or a custom pattern in M for each projection year that is a factor (1 is no change)}
}
\description{
A wrapper function that modifies the cpars slot of the OM object to control the value and trajectory of natural mortality rate and recruitment strength for projection years.

\examples{
OM_proj_mod(OM.MC.E, M_val = c(0.2,0.3), M_trend = 1, Rtrend = -1)
